Current Theatrical Coordinator based at Warner Bros. 

Experienced in creative content localisation, digital marketing, and Agile project management. Worked closely with Warner Bros, SAP, and local businesses in Dorset. 

I built this website (using Gatsby & React) so I can share some of my experiences and projects.
