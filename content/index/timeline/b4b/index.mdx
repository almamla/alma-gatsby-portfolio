During UK‚Äôs first lockdown, I luckily got the job opportunity to manage software projects for a local marketing agency. <a href="https://www.cobraribs.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" aria-label="External Link"><Underlining color={Theme.colors.tertiary} hoverColor={Theme.colors.secondary}>Cobra Ribs</Underlining></a> is one of our most recent projects which I had a lot of fun creating.
