During the UK’s first lockdown, I got the job opportunity to manage software projects for an independent marketing agency. <a href="https://www.cobraribs.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" aria-label="External Link"><u>Cobra Ribs</u></a> is one of our recent projects which I had a lot of fun creating.
