Helping small local businesses grow (mid-pandemic) was incredibly rewarding. <a href="https://www.cobraribs.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" aria-label="External Link"><u>Cobra Ribs</u></a> and <a href="https://www.mass-concrete.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" aria-label="External Link"><u>Mass Concrete</u></a> are some of the projects that I had a lot of fun creating.
